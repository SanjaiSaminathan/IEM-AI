    5. How facilities management can future-proof your business
    Strategic facilities management is a powerful tool for those that know how to use it. For many businesses, estate management is often reactive and fails to develop assets and add value to portfolios.
    
    The global pandemic has been hugely disruptive in the field of estate management. First, many premises were abandoned – virtually overnight – for an unknown period of time. Now, as we plan a return, organisations are having to make drastic changes to the way they use their sites in order to keep staff safe. Designing resilience into assets can not only protect them but aid the organisation as a whole.
    
    This must start with an in-depth understanding of the estate, it’s strengths and its weaknesses. For many, hard elements of FM have been hugely challenging over the previous months since they are designed to function with the building at near full capacity.
    
    Failure to manage this situation can result in a lack of compliance. At worst, this can lead to dangerous health outcomes as was seen with an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease earlier this year. Understanding risk allows potentially costly and hazardous problems to be avoided.
    
    Once the fundamental needs of the organisation are met by its estate, attention can be turned to increasing the value of assets. Sites and premises should be viewed in terms of their potential. The upkeep of under-utilised sites is a resource drain.
    
    Instead, these areas should become a focus for redevelopment. Real estate should add value to the organisation through by enhancing the safety and productivity of a site.. Portfolio optimisation is a key way of financially streamlining an organisation, providing a buffer for unexpected spends or greater potential for investing into development.
    
    An area garnering increasing attention is the creation of a workplace that supports the productivity and wellbeing of employees. Future-proofing is about embracing change. The way we work will continue to evolve, especially as we continue to recover from the pandemic.
    
    Spaces should be designed to allow for agile working and changes in working style. The most flexible thing in a space is never the furniture, nor the walls. It’s the people. Space should encourage movement, creative work, and facilitate safety.
    
    The space should also reflect and encourage a strong workplace culture. A close-knit workplace culture is important for keeping staff motivated and engaged even when times are difficult. Staff that feel supported and at home in their workplace will be more loyal.
    
    Finally, the sustainability of the workplace will be under ever greater scrutiny in the coming years. With many of the greatest challenges business face, including the global pandemic, traced back to unsustainable practices, the pressure will be on everyone to do better.
    
    Estate managers can save on costs and improve the reputation of an organisation by implementing sustainable practices. From insulation and waste disposal to buying furniture made of more eco-friendly material, the possibilities are endless.
    
    The role of the estate manager is both to be a creative problem solver and a visionary for the potential of the portfolio. Those with a strong understanding of estate management and how it aligns with the organisation’s priorities have a powerful tool at their fingertips.
    
    
    5. Meet the Team: Alistair Scott
    What is your role at IEM and what does it involve day to day?
    I am responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company and all the technical support elements. This involves making sure the team have the right tools, equipment and support to do a great job. By doing this, the team are then enabled to get the best out of themselves. I don’t like micro-management, so I like to agree success criteria up-front with the team and then allow them to do it their way.
    
    I enjoy getting involved in the fulfilment of the large technical projects and ensuring they are executed correctly, to a high standard and on time. A lot of my time is also spent on maintaining and growing client relationships, ensuring the customer experience is always to a high standard.
    
    How did you find your way into estate management? (Tell us a bit about your background)
    I was trained as an engineer in the military. Concurrently, this is where I grew as a leader, deploying and leading teams when training or in operation. This taught me how to lead, manage, and develop a diverse group of individuals. I molded them into a highly effective team that was capable of delivering a variety of complex projects on a timely basis and across a variety of environments.
    
    It doesn’t surprise me that there are a lot of ex-military personnel working in facilities management as there are many traits that are similar.
    
    I got involved initially from the engineering angle, as I understood electrical, mechanical, and electronic systems. On top of that, I had the leadership competency to put people in the right place, with the right piece of equipment to do the job first time….which at the end of the day is facilities management.An estate manager using a tablet during a site visit
    
    What is your favourite thing about your job/the industry?
    I absolutely love what I do. What really excites me is that no two days are the same. It’s a really diverse industry when it comes to all the different problems that come up on a daily basis. Therefore, you're constantly thinking and challenging yourself. It keeps your brain moving and allows you to stay engaged. You naturally feel ecstatic when you do something good for someone. We're not going in and smashing the place up, we're going in to make things work, adding value to businesses and buildings and landlords. For me, this is really exciting and my favourite part of the job.
    
    How could the industry be improved?
    The biggest challenge we’ve faced as an industry is people’s perspective of us, and their understanding of what we offer. However, I think we’ve already started seeing improvements in this area. Years ago, businesses went to large FM companies to do everything for them. Now, companies are realising that having the right people with the right skill set within the facilities management sphere, is more of a benefit than just going to a general FM provider. It's like the high street, people are flocking back to local butchers or bakers because it’s more personal and better quality. FM is no different, people like going to specialists within their field but they also want that personal touch.
    
    What are your key predictions for/the biggest issues facing the estate management industry over the next year?
    Technology is really being pushed and for the right reasons. However, I have on a few occasions added a cautionary warning into going down this route. Overall, I really like IOT, especially if utilised correctly. It can give you plenty of warning if things go wrong, telling you if something’s going to fail, and can be really useful for a range of services. However, it’s important we still remember the basics and not rely heavily on technology. A trend I’m seeing is technology taking so much of the limelight that the fundamentals are being forgotten. As much as advancements in technology is a good thing, the basics can’t be forgotten. It all links back to simplicity, you don’t always need lots of advanced equipment and the latest tech, just the right tools and the right people.
    
    What is your biggest passion/favourite hobby outside of work?
    A Formula 1 car on the race trackI am a massive motor-sport fan. I follow all genres and types, whether it be road cars, British Touring Cars, or Formula 1. I am also heavily involved with amateur race driving and even motorbikes. If it’s motorized and fast, I love it.
    
    Gone are the days I really get involved in the tinkering element, but the driving experience and that team ethic of everybody in a team working towards a common goal, as well as achieving that goal on time, is what I still love and have taken into the business arena.
    
    My other major passion is cooking. For me there is nothing more relaxing than cooking a meal for family and friends, with everyone sitting around a table on weekends, chatting and enjoying the experience. These are those special moments that we missed during Covid times, that I can’t wait to start doing again.
    
    6. Why support for facilities managers is essential as buildings reopen
    One of the side effects of the pandemic, working from home and the workplace revolution is that we all have a greater appreciation of the impact of buildings on our mental health and wellbeing. But what about the mental health of those charged with managing buildings as they reopen?
    
    Many businesses may look to adopt a hybrid work model post-pandemic, but the reality is that most buildings are on track to be fully reopened in June when the Covid restrictions end. Many of these spaces have been dormant or below occupancy for more than a year and compliance might have fallen by the wayside.
    
    Ensuring buildings are safe to reopen is not just about cleaning and hygiene. It’s about ensuring that all aspects are compliant, and that duty falls to estate managers. That level of accountability is a big burden and will undoubtably be the cause of much stress for those individuals.
    
    An anxious return?
    
    It’s quite clear that the onus is on employers to help building occupants feel supported in their mental health, and estate managers have a big role to play.
    
    There will be plenty of people that are excited to get back to the office, but there will be just as many that are anxious about the return.
    
    Business leaders too will be anxious. They want to ensure the safety of their employees, clients, and customers. They also have a financial risk to consider. If a building fails compliance, that might lead to a fine or the space being shut down. That could be highly disruptive to the business.
    
    Estate managers must manage these risks and communicate with leadership and building users how and when they have been mitigated. It’s a big weight to carry and we businesses must ensure that their estate managers have the support they need – not just through the tools they need to do their jobs, but on the wellbeing side too.
    
    Supporting estate managers
    
    Estate teams should already be working in close consultation with other senior leaders. Since the pandemic struck and the role of the building was amplified, many estate managers have found themselves to have an elevated voice in the business. Now is the time to capitalise and ensure that this remains the case long after the pandemic.
    
    Estate managers should share how and why they are managing various tasks, from compliance to lighting, and water safety to energy management. For their part, business leaders must do all they can to support them in achieving their goals.
    
    This could include the creation of an up-to-date asset list; an audit of building condition; compliance inspections and assessments; prioritising projects; and the delivery itself.
    
    This can be a hugely demanding workload for a team, let alone a one-man band. In many cases it can be beneficial to partner with an expert consultant to help manage one of more areas of estate management. Business leaders can support their teams by being open to this option.
    
    This is not just a ‘nice to do’. This is essential in supporting the mental health of estate managers, and in turn the business.

    8. The future is bright; the future is simple
    Facilities Management shouldn't be this complicated!
    
    When IEM was founded, we did not want to perpetuate the confusion and complexity often associated with FM, so we made the decision to keep things simple.
    
    There were various reasons for this thinking, but the most important of these was the bad reputation that the industry had acquired, mainly due to its somewhat chequered history.
    
    According to Reuters, one of the primary reasons FM businesses have struggled in recent years (Carillion and Interserve spring to mind) is the continuous hamster wheel of signing long fixed-rate contracts at un-sustainable pricing.
    
    Complicating the services offered to clients makes it easier to hide the real cost and mask the value customers are getting.
    
    Simplifying complexity is a skill that most great businesses and leaders possess, but it is sometimes missing in FM.
    
    "Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean, to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end, because once you get there you can move mountains" Steve Jobs
    
    As the world becomes smaller, the ease with which businesses can get information into the marketplace becomes even easier. However, the need for quality content that stands out becomes ever more necessary.
    
    Selling service-driven products is challenging, especially in a world of so much noise, quality content and competition. When trying to justify a price-point, expensive complex products are usually perceived as more merited than simple ones.
    
    Successful organisations and leaders are highly skilled in simplifying this complexity, instead of "complexifying” simplicity.  However, if you get it wrong, this can confuse your customers, who nod their heads politely but have no clue how you will ease their pain points.
    
    Clarity and simplicity
    
    "If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough" Albert Einstein
    
    Any industry focused on selling to the lowest bidder will always have underlying challenges, especially if that industry relates to services. The way many businesses overcome this issue is through "Bundling" or giving perceived value. After all, it is easy to compare apples with apples (hourly rate of jobs, materials and length of time) but much harder to compare the more subjective elements (quality, management fees and administrative support.)
    
    FM has always been an industry famous for its acronyms and hidden costs; that’s why there is a need for clarity and a much more simplistic approach. Good FM companies will sell real features and services that customers genuinely need, rather than perceived value, due to "Bundling" features that clients will never use.
    
    One of the main challenges the FM industry has had, is that they have to come in at the lowest price and give the perception of more added value. The FM industry needs to understand the power of clarity and simplicity.
    
    When building a sustainable business, concepts, jargon and complex features should never be at the expense of customer benefits.
    
    The next few years should bring a shift from the complicated world of hidden features and acronyms that nobody understands, to a drive for removing complexity and replacing it with simplicity.
    
    The Future is bright
    
    Outsourced providers will need to add more value than before. Increased spending budgets to get businesses up and running as soon as possible will create more business opportunities.  FM companies that can adapt quickly, focus on the basics, without the bells and whistles, whilst helping customers prioritise, are the most likely to flourish and grow.
    
    Other reasons why 2021 will be bright for the FM industry include:
    
    Cost reduction may be necessary, but organisations will also need to free up more funds to get their estates trading in super-fast time.
    With many buildings closed for so long, there will need to be urgent investments in Health and Safety, including compliance checks.
    FM/Property Managers will suddenly have more exposure and be at the forefront of strategic decision making.
    IoT and AI advances will make the industry sexier, especially the drive towards predictive and preventative maintenance - however, this may need to be put on hold for a short while, as businesses open safely and get their basics right first.
    Employees will probably want to get back to their workplaces and interact face to face with their work colleagues once more, and this will be a crucial part of facilities teams’ activities over the Spring and Summer months.
    There will be a level of urgency not seen for many years, so the demand for services will be very high.
    If FM companies get things right and make it easier for customers to attain more value, the next 12-24 months could be one of the most exciting times in history for the industry. Getting estates up and running in a post-covid world, will bring many opportunities for FM businesses to grow and for clients to build workplaces that will be business enhancers, not just cost centres.
    
    We were set up with the goal of simplifying estate management. Contact us today to discuss how we can support your business.
    
    9. 5 key considerations for facilities management when reopening a building
    The current lockdown means that many workplaces have become vacant again, or at the very least continue to be vastly under-occupied. Though it may feel like a return to normal is a long way off, estate and facilities managers must prepare now for that time.
    
    When the restrictions do ease, a lot of businesses may see a clamour from employees who want to get back to their place of work. This process cannot be rushed and estate managers have a vital role to play in ensuring that a workplace is ready to be occupied again.
    
    There are of course numerous things to consider to get a workplace ready to reopen. Here are five of the most important.
    
    Hygiene
    This may seem obvious, but it’s absolutely critical to stay on top of hygiene. This includes keeping updated with the latest information from the Government and health bodies, as well as implementing strong hygiene processes at a site. Estate managers should act as a key consultant to organisations. Even though we are ten months into the pandemic, it cannot be assumed that all building occupants will know or follow the best hygiene practices, so signage and consistent communication with all occupants is a must.
    HVAC
    We know that the virus is increasingly airborne. HVAC systems must be assessed and adapted to ensure that they provide a strong defence against airborne transmission. This can include the type of air filters used, the frequency they are changed and the percentage of outside air pumped into a building. Where possible, windows should be left open to increase ventilation.
    Compliance
    Compliance covers everything from fire risk to electrical, and legionella to asbestos. In buildings that have spent any time vacant or with reduced occupancy, it’s highly likely that checks will need to be made before full occupancy to avoid both fines and health and safety breaches. Take water systems, for example. Many are designed under the assumption of regular flushing due to full a site being fully occupied. Times of irregular flushing can provide an opportunity for bacteria to flourish, which in the worst case scenario can lead to an outbreak of legionella. Estate managers should assume nothing is compliant as they prepare a site for reopening.
    Asset management
    Even the most up-to-date asset registries will need going over with a fine tooth comb ahead of a building reopening. It’s likely that the condition of many assets will have changed in the last year. For businesses without an understanding of its assets and their condition, this represents an opportune time to carry out an in-depth survey. This will also be an important step in ensuring compliance.
    Project management
    The sheer numbers of estate management tasks can be daunting for even the most experienced estate managers, let alone for small and medium sized businesses that may not have the in-house resources to cope. It’s worth partnering with a project manager to handle the process. The expertise is invaluable and any money spend will be made back many times over in workplace optimisation and the avoidance of fines for breaches of compliance.

    10.  How to make facilities management simple and effective
    Facilities management, at its heart, is about looking after things. It is a vast role and may appear inherently complex, but it does not need to be difficult. By simplifying each of the elements of estate management, it is possible to create a streamlined and cohesive approach.
    
    For many, the instinct is to outsource to a large facilities management (FM) organisation with expertise in estate management. However, this isn’t an option for many smaller and mid-sized companies.
    
    Yet opting for the cheapest option on the market risks shelling out for a service that doesn’t do justice to the estate. For those managing their estate themselves, it can feel like an overwhelming challenge just to meet compliance measures and the time and resources this requires can distract from transforming the estate into a genuine business asset.
    
    In virtually every sector, organisations are looking to simplify and streamline their processes. This is possible with estate management too. By breaking the process down, it becomes easier to address each of the core elements of management, meet key targets, and understand priorities.
    
    Understanding what assets an estate possesses should be the key objective of an estate manager. Location, condition, life span, and economic value should all be identified. This should then be followed by a more in-depth investigation into the condition of those assets. Here, risks can be identified and precautions taken.
    
    Ensuring compliance is vital in any estate; non-compliance can come with unplanned costs and long-term damage to reputation. An understanding of asset condition allows compliance requirements to be met.
    
    From here, an organisation is in a position to plan for the future, begin forecasting capital expenditure and planning for tenders. A five-year plan can be produced with key compliance and business critical remedials prioritised according to risk. Finally, improvements and projects can go ahead, be they adjustments and refurbishment or major upgrades.
    
    By creating a step-by-step process, each element of estate management becomes manageable and vital aspects won’t be overlooked. Once your organisation understands precisely which areas of the estate need work and what needs doing, you are in a much better position to look for the best experts for the job. Simplifying the process makes it both transparent and accessible.
    
    While the remit of estate management is extremely broad, it is an opportunity to take a holistic view of the organisation’s assets. Once the process has been demystified, it can be an opportunity to build on what the organisation has in order to create an estate that reflects the business culture and feels like a home for its people.
    
    Excellence in estate management requires strategic thinking and continuous evaluation of the estate. For those new to this approach, there is a big learning curve, but streamlining the process makes it accessible to all.

    According to Compare Soft, an effective asset register can have an impact on your revenue and cash flow by 5 – 18 per cent. We identify your assets and their location, condition, life span and economic value. We leave no stone unturned in creating an up-to-date register.
    Identify assets and location
    Condition
    Life span
    Economic value
    
    2. Understand Your Condition
    Evaluating the condition of an estate is a daunting prospect. We survey your buildings, identify construction and repair requirements, identify any risks and collate the data into a user friendly report.
    Survey your buildings
    Identify construction and repair condition
    Identify your risks
    Collate data
    
    3. Control Your Compliance
    The cost of health and safety fines is routinely higher than the cost of compliance. Businesses also have a duty to protect their employees and customers. We assess your current compliance position, check it against the latest legal guidance, carry out compliance inspections and categorise remedial and improvement actions. The end result is you will be fully compliant and have an easy way to manage compliance moving forwards.

    6. Frequently Asked Questions
    What is facilities management?
    Facilities management encompasses every aspect of a property, including electrical, water, lighting, health and safety, maintenance and compliance. It's also commonly referred to as estate management.
    
    Are your contractors certified and monitored?
    Does IEM just do repairs?
    IEM deliver all aspects of total building maintenance from planned, reactive to technical projects.
    
    Do you offer 24-hour (24/7) support?
    Yes, we are available 24/7, feel free to call any time for assistance and support
    
    Why did you come up with "The 5-point plan"?
    IEM was created in order to simplify the complexity of estate management, the 5-point plan is the framework that underpins our philosophy
    
    Why does IEM believe simplicity (removing the complexity) is so important?
    Through our extensive estate management experience, we identified that the complexity within maintaining a building leads to in-action, frustration and risk.
    
    Why is facilities management important?
    There are numerous benefits to effective facilities management. It is essential to remain compliant across all facets of an estate to avoid fines and to ensure that all occupants are safe while on the premises. Strong estate management practices can also transform a property from a risk to an asset. A well maintained estate can also be a big driver towards creating a productive working environment.
    
    What services do IEM provide?
    We provide every element of estate management, from asset management through to programme delivery. We have a nationwide network of more than 2,500 engineers that can be called upon at a moment’s notice to carry out any job.
    
    Can I pick and choose what services I need from IEM?
    Absolutely. You can engage us for our entire Five Point Plan or we can tailor a unique plan just for your estate. We will work seamlessly with your in-house team or other contracted services.
    
    How much does facilities management cost?
    This can vary depending on the size of your estate and the services you require. Contact us to find out more.

   1.Extra Information.
    Category Name Entered:  Best Company To Work For\n\u2022\tName of Entrant: Christy Smith\n\u2022\tEmail Address of Entrant: 
    c.smith@integrated-em.com\n\u2022\tDirect Telephone Number of Entrant:  07944624543\n\u2022\tName of Entry: Integrated Estate Management Ltd 
    (IEM) \nWho are IEM? We are a forward-thinking FM company that specialises in hard services across the UK, utilising a robust network of 
    Partners to deliver comprehensive solutions. We support many key clients, ranging from providing reactive maintenance to full FM coverage 
    and managing large-scale projects. Our mission is simple: simplifying the complexity of Facilities Management for our clients. Too often, 
    FM managers sit at the back during Christmas parties, only noticed when a chair or table breaks, and given the blame! We want to change this 
    #narrative by ensuring that the FM teams we work with receive the recognition they deserve. Our goal is for these managers to be seen as 
    integral to the success of their organisations.

    At IEM, our story began with a vision born out of adversity. The initial few of us joined IEM after being made redundant during the challenging times of COVID-19. Our lives were turned upside down, but this difficult situation inspired Alistair to create something different. He founded IEM with a clear goal: not to be the most profitable company in the world, but to be a company that genuinely cares about its people and clients.\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on building a lean team that is treated fairly, empowered, and supported every step of the way. Our approach has been to remove any sense of hierarchy; it's not just the Directors and Managers who matter here\u2014everyone plays a crucial role. This is central to our culture and defines who we are as a company.
    Our Values: At IEM, our core values drive everything we do and shape the environment we create for both our team and our clients. We are skilful and ambitious, always striving for excellence in our work and seeking opportunities to grow and improve. We genuinely care about our people, our clients, and the communities we serve. With a positive mindset, we embrace challenges as opportunities, focusing on solutions and fostering a culture of optimism and teamwork. We are agile and brave, adapting quickly to change and confidently taking on new challenges in an ever-evolving industry. We own it and deliver, taking responsibility for our actions and outcomes, always holding ourselves to the highest standards. Most importantly, we do this together collaborating, supporting one another, and creating an environment where every individual feels empowered to contribute.\nThese values are more than just words; they are the foundation of who we are and how we work.
    
    Key Initiatives and Employee Benefits:\n1.\tCompany-Wide Bonus: At IEM, we share our success with our people. Last year, after hitting our turnover target, we awarded every employee with a company-wide bonus. Those with a full year of service took home a minimum of \u00a36,000, with pro-rated bonuses for others. This initiative saw 75% of our annual profit given to our team, a reflection of our belief that success should be shared. We are continuing with a similar bonus structure this year, and it\u2019s something we are incredibly excited about. This financial recognition reflects our commitment to rewarding the entire team for their hard work. \n2.\tPrivate Healthcare: We provide comprehensive private healthcare to all employees who pass their probation. This isn't just basic healthcare; we've upgraded the package to include mental health care support, dental coverage, and eye care. We believe in supporting the complete well-being of our staff\u2014physically, mentally, and emotionally. By offering enhanced healthcare benefits, we ensure our employees feel supported both at work and in their personal lives. Mental health care is especially crucial, and we want our team to have access to the resources they need to stay healthy and thrive.\n3.\tEmployee-Led Initiatives: We listen to our people. For example, after requests from our team, we are implementing \"bring your dog to work\" days, a simple but meaningful change that boosts morale and makes the workplace more enjoyable. These days not only add a sense of fun to the work environment but also contribute to reducing stress and improving mental well-being. Studies have shown that interacting with pets can lower anxiety and increase positivity, making this initiative a valuable addition to our workplace. \n4.\tPromotion from Within & Growth Opportunities: As we've grown from a team of 3-4 people to over 30, we\u2019re committed to succession planning. Whether someone wants to become a project manager or chase a completely different career path, such as becoming an astronaut, we\u2019re here to help them on their journey. \n5.\tProfessional Development: We are committed to investing in the growth and development of our team. Currently, four of our staff members are receiving coaching to help them achieve their individual goals. We offer a wide range of training opportunities tailored to each team member's ambitions, ensuring everyone has the tools they need to grow in their roles. This includes carrying out a company-wide skills matrix, which will allow us to offer IWFM memberships and better understand everyone\u2019s knowledge and development needs. Just this week, our team participated in a \"Delivering Excellent Service Consistently\" training session, and we have several staff members undergone first aid training. Additionally, we provide full access to the IHASCO training platform, where all employees can benefit from a wide variety of modules. \n6.\tPersonalised Support: At IEM, we go above and beyond to support our people in times of need. Recently, when one of our team members' car broke down, we ensured they had a courtesy car ready so they weren\u2019t stuck at home. This small act reflects our broader ethos\u2014our employees' personal challenges are our challenges, and we\u2019ll always step up to help.\n7.\tReward and Recognition: At IEM, we believe in celebrating the achievements and milestones of our team. We ensure that every work anniversary is marked with a thoughtful reward. For example, I recently received a bracelet for my 4-year anniversary, which was extra special because the team remembered I had my eye on it. A few years ago, during a challenging period, I was gifted a Chanel handbag, a gesture (and handbag) that I\u2019ll cherish forever! We also encourage the team to run their own initiatives\u2014right now, we\u2019re doing a \"Star of the Week\" for reducing open tasks, which has been a big hit, keeping everyone motivated and engaged.\n8.\tAdditional Benefits: we offer a range of thoughtful benefits that reflect our commitment to creating a supportive work environment. This includes birthdays off, an additional annual leave day for each year of service (uncapped), and flexibility to manage work-life balance. We understand that life happens outside of work, so we allow our team the flexibility to work from home when needed or adjust schedules around childcare commitments. Recently, a new starter was struggling with \"single dad guilt\" due to childcare issues during school holidays, so we gave him every Friday off, fully paid, for the first five weeks of his employment to support him during that transition. \nClient Care and Dedication: Our dedication to clients mirrors our care for employees. A standout example of this commitment occurred when one of our clients needed urgent furniture removal at a site five hours away from our helpdesk. Despite being unable to secure a team in time, one of our helpdesk team members, who was fully qualified to carry out the removal, took it upon themselves to hire a van and drive to the site personally to complete the task. This willingness to go the extra mile is ingrained in our culture and exemplifies how we consistently prioritise our clients\u2019 needs, ensuring they receive top-tier service.
    
    Team Spirit and Collaboration: One of our strongest assets is the close-knit, collaborative environment we\u2019ve cultivated. Despite our growth, we maintain the spirit of a small, tightly connected team. Regular social events, team-building activities, and an inclusive culture make IEM a fun and dynamic place to work. Recently, we enjoyed an exhilarating team-building day at a rage room and axe throwing event, which was a huge hit with the team. We also host fantastic Christmas parties every year and an annual BBQ that everyone looks forward to. This sense of togetherness fuels our productivity and makes IEM an exciting and supportive workplace.
    
    Mental Health and Wellbeing Support: We understand the importance of mental health, especially in today\u2019s high-pressure world. In addition to healthcare benefits and counselling available, we are rolling out more mental health support initiatives to ensure that everyone at IEM feels cared for, both physically and mentally, which our Mental health champion is involved in.
    
    Charity: At IEM, we are proud to support Scotty's Little Soldiers, a charity dedicated to aiding children who have lost parents serving in the military or veterans who have passed away. Supporting such a meaningful cause aligns with our core values of care, empathy, and giving back. It\u2019s not just about being successful in business for us; it\u2019s also about making a difference in the wider community and positively impacting the lives of those in need. Our team is deeply committed to this cause, and we continually look for ways to support and give back.
    Veterans Support: Our founder, Alistair, is an ex-armed forces member and co-chair of the IWFM Veterans in FM network, which underscores our commitment to supporting veterans transitioning into civilian employment. At IEM, we proudly hold the Armed Forces Covenant Bronze Award and are actively working towards achieving the Silver Award. We are dedicated to creating pathways for veterans to build successful careers in FM, providing tailored support, mentorship, and opportunities to leverage the valuable skills they bring from their military service. Supporting veterans isn\u2019t just a pledge\u2014it\u2019s an integral part of our company\u2019s values and mission.
    
    Accreditations and Awards: We are proud recipients of the Silver Award for Neutral Carbon Zone, which underscores our dedication to reducing our environmental impact and supporting a sustainable future. Our ISO certifications (9001, 14001, 45001) demonstrate our adherence to best practices in quality management, environmental stewardship, and occupational health and safety. We are also accredited by Safe Contractor, highlighting our commitment to maintaining high standards of health and safety across all operations. Our founder, Alistair, has been recognised as one of the Top 50 Workplace Leaders, a prestigious honour that showcases his leadership and commitment to fostering a positive workplace culture. In addition, IEM holds the National Living Wage accreditation, ensuring that all our employees are compensated fairly, in line with the real cost of living. These achievements exemplify our dedication to industry standards, employee well-being, and environmental responsibility.
    
    Diversity and inclusion: We recognise that diversity and inclusion are essential to creating a vibrant and innovative workplace. We actively promote awareness of these values through our dedicated Diversity Champion, who helps to normalise conversations around equality and representation.\nMoving forward, we will establish a committee focused on diversity and inclusion, which will introduce new awareness days and initiatives aimed at fostering a more inclusive environment. Our commitment to becoming a Disability Confident Employer reflects our desire to nurture a culture where everyone feels comfortable being themselves. We are dedicated to promoting a supportive atmosphere that celebrates equality and diversity, ensuring that all team members are valued and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives.
    Employee Turnover \u2013 What Employee Turnover?! Since our inception, IEM has proudly maintained an exceptional employee retention rate, having lost only one permanent member of staff. This remarkable achievement speaks volumes about our company culture, values, and the supportive environment we've cultivated.

   The Next 12 Months at IEM The upcoming year promises exciting developments at IEM as we continue to invest in our people and business. We are introducing death in service benefits to provide added peace of mind to our team and their families. To ensure transparency and fairness, we will be rolling out a pay banding, offering clear career progression and salary structures. We're also committed to enhancing our benefits with better pensions to support long-term financial well-being.\nSabbaticals are on the horizon to offer our staff time to pursue personal passions or recharge, ensuring they come back more motivated and fulfilled. We're also setting our sights on B Corp certification, which will be a huge deal for us!\nTeam spirit will remain a core focus, with exciting team-building activities, such as a company-wide sports day, to foster collaboration and camaraderie. Additionally, we will launch our very own Corporate University, providing ongoing professional development and training opportunities tailored to each employee's growth ambitions.

   Conclusion: At IEM, it\u2019s not just about profits, it\u2019s about people. We believe that a company is only as strong as the people behind it, and that\u2019s why we strive to create a work environment where every employee feels valued, supported, and empowered. From company-wide bonuses and private healthcare to flexible working arrangements and personalised support, we\u2019re always looking for ways to make IEM the best company to work for.\nWe hope this application demonstrates our unwavering commitment to our employees, clients, and community\u2014and why we believe IEM truly deserves to be recognised as the Best Company to Work For.

Experience\n7.1 Relevant Experience\nIEM brings extensive experience in successfully operating under framework agreements across the UK and Ireland, notably with distinguished partners such as NHS West Suffolk Trust and Arnold Clark.\nWith Arnold Clark, IEM has demonstrated its commitment to excellence through seamless integration into a framework agreement over the past 36 months. Recently renewed for an additional 36 months, this enduring partnership underscores the quality of service provided. During this period, IEM efficiently managed hundreds of reactive tasks on average nationwide. Leveraging a network of safe contractor-approved partners, IEM addressed various disciplines, including plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and roofing. Additionally, IEM completed multiple small to medium projects for Arnold Clark, including internal refurbishments valued between \u00a3120k to \u00a3150k and roof repairs ranging from \u00a320k to \u00a3100k.\nSimilarly, under the framework agreement with NHS West Suffolk Trust, in place for the past 18 months, IEM delivers exceptional reactive and Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) services. Integral to this partnership is IEM\u2019s support for the maintenance and ongoing operation of MRI equipment, requiring\n15\nboth reactive interventions and regular PPM for chillers and refrigeration systems crucial to MRI operations. This demonstrates IEM\u2019s commitment to providing specialised and reliable services tailored to the unique needs of its esteemed clientele.\n7.2 Past Performance\nIn reviewing our past performance, one standout achievement is our successful execution of a framework agreement supporting IVC Vetinary practises with reactive work over the past 12 months. This endeavour encompassed managing reactive requirements across IVC\u2019s extensive UK estate, comprising approximately 1200 buildings.\nOur commitment to excellence was evident in adhering meticulously to our service level agreement (SLA) targets, ensuring timely task completion. We aimed to address P1 tasks within a remarkable 4-hour window, followed by P2 tasks within 24 hours, P3 tasks within 5 days, and P4 tasks within 30 days. This precision in service delivery minimised disruption to IVC\u2019s operations while upholding responsiveness and effectiveness.\nKey to our success was the utilisation of a central rate card in collaboration with the client, facilitating streamlined management of the reactive workload. Despite handling 400 to 450 tasks weekly, we maintained efficiency and reliability without encountering any claims throughout the 12-month period.\nTransparency and accountability were paramount, demonstrated through comprehensive weekly and monthly management information reports provided to the client. These reports aided decision-making processes and facilitated a thorough assessment of our performance against agreed SLAs. Weekly operational calls with our dedicated support manager ensured open communication and proactive resolution of emerging challenges.\nThe success of our partnership with IVC is evidenced by our recent agreement to expand collaboration, encompassing not only reactive works but also Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) and project works across their entire portfolio.\n8.

Experience\n7.1 Relevant Experience\nIEM brings extensive experience in successfully operating under framework agreements across the UK and Ireland, notably with distinguished partners such as NHS West Suffolk Trust and Arnold Clark.\nWith Arnold Clark, IEM has demonstrated its commitment to excellence through seamless integration into a framework agreement over the past 36 months. Recently renewed for an additional 36 months, this enduring partnership underscores the quality of service provided. During this period, IEM efficiently managed hundreds of reactive tasks on average nationwide. Leveraging a network of safe contractor-approved partners, IEM addressed various disciplines, including plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and roofing. Additionally, IEM completed multiple small to medium projects for Arnold Clark, including internal refurbishments valued between \u00a3120k to \u00a3150k and roof repairs ranging from \u00a320k to \u00a3100k.\nSimilarly, under the framework agreement with NHS West Suffolk Trust, in place for the past 18 months, IEM delivers exceptional reactive and Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) services. Integral to this partnership is IEM\u2019s support for the maintenance and ongoing operation of MRI equipment, requiring\n15\nboth reactive interventions and regular PPM for chillers and refrigeration systems crucial to MRI operations. This demonstrates IEM\u2019s commitment to providing specialised and reliable services tailored to the unique needs of its esteemed clientele.\n7.2 Past Performance\nIn reviewing our past performance, one standout achievement is our successful execution of a framework agreement supporting IVC Vetinary practises with reactive work over the past 12 months. This endeavour encompassed managing reactive requirements across IVC\u2019s extensive UK estate, comprising approximately 1200 buildings.\nOur commitment to excellence was evident in adhering meticulously to our service level agreement (SLA) targets, ensuring timely task completion. We aimed to address P1 tasks within a remarkable 4-hour window, followed by P2 tasks within 24 hours, P3 tasks within 5 days, and P4 tasks within 30 days. This precision in service delivery minimised disruption to IVC\u2019s operations while upholding responsiveness and effectiveness.\nKey to our success was the utilisation of a central rate card in collaboration with the client, facilitating streamlined management of the reactive workload. Despite handling 400 to 450 tasks weekly, we maintained efficiency and reliability without encountering any claims throughout the 12-month period.\nTransparency and accountability were paramount, demonstrated through comprehensive weekly and monthly management information reports provided to the client. These reports aided decision-making processes and facilitated a thorough assessment of our performance against agreed SLAs. Weekly operational calls with our dedicated support manager ensured open communication and proactive resolution of emerging challenges.\nThe success of our partnership with IVC is evidenced by our recent agreement to expand collaboration, encompassing not only reactive works but also Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) and project works across their entire portfolio.\n8.

Our commitment to transparency, accountability, and innovation ensures that our partnership will be characterised by open communication, mutual trust, and a shared commitment to excellence.\nBy leveraging advanced technology like the AIMS CAFM system and drawing upon our extensive experience in managing complex frameworks, including our successful collaborations with organisations like Arnold Clark and NHS West Suffolk Trust, we are well-equipped to support Voyage Care in achieving its goals.\nOur tailored approach, designed specifically for Voyage Care as an integrated estate partner, ensures that every aspect of our service delivery is aligned with your objectives.

  Good dental care really matters. We provide dental care for 1.5 million patients every year across the UK and Ireland. Today, we support over 370 practices, partner with more than 2,400 clinicians and empower more than 4,500 practice colleagues \u2013 to enable better health and happiness across lifetimes.  Our practices are integral parts of their local communities, and we support our clinicians and practice teams to deliver the best care possible for their patients, every day.  We know that every patient and every community is unique.  As a dental group we strive to balance celebrating the individuality of our clinicians and practices, with using the benefits of our scale and commitment to deliver excellent dental care.  We\u2019re also part of the wider Portman Healthcare International Group which has a presence in five European countries.\n1.2\tProject Context, Background and Strategic Objectives".

  Following the merger of Portman Dental Care and Dentex Health in 2023, we now operate as PortmanDentex.  The recently combined business forms one of the largest dental groups in the UK with plans to continue our exciting growth.  \n1.2.2\tNow operating as one business, a review of PortmanDentex\u2019s ways of working has been undertaken with a view to taking the best elements of each legacy business, whilst improving and optimising our set up, given our larger scale.  \n1.2.3\tAs we have brought the two legacy businesses together, it has heightened the need for the business to review the approach as to how we manage our estate,  how we provide exceptional service and maintain standards to our practices and practice based colleagues, how we procure property services and, ultimately, how we manage our growing estate in a more efficient and strategic manner.   \n1.2.4\tMaintenance services today are delivered across the estate in a broadly decentralised manner.  Practice Managers are accountable for their individual practice P&Ls and in many instances will determine when, how and who carries out their maintenance, particularly from a non-urgent reactive maintenance perspective.  As a result, contractors are not routinely managed from a relationship or standards perspective.  \n1.2.5\tA reactive maintenance framework was put in place by the legacy Portman Property and Procurement team in 2020, although this is not widely used, managed or enforced today.  Legacy Dentex practices have historically always used their own locally procured contractors for reactive and planned maintenance.

  Due to PortmanDentex\u2019s rapid growth via M&A over the past five years and our strategic objectives to manage FM in a more holistic manner, the contractors that were selected on the 2020 framework are no longer the right partners for our future aspirations.  \n1.2.7\tPlanned Maintenance, generally statutory property compliance testing and risk assessments, for the legacy Portman estate are coordinated centrally by PortmanDentex\u2019s in-house Safety and Quality (S&Q) team with any remedial works required being managed by the PortmanDentex in-house Property team.  \n1.2.8\tLegacy Dentex sites have historically been locally managed and coordinated by each site and as such, visibility of remedial work undertaken following risk assessments and statutory property compliance testing is less documented.  For risk assessments, we are now inspecting the legacy Dentex estate in the same format as the Portman one and so we anticipate more remedial activity for legacy Dentex sites during 2026 onwards, following risk assessments and compliance testing carried out during 2025.  \n1.2.9\tRemedial works are tendered by the Property team with support from our current property consultancy supplier, Border Consultancy.  Payment is made once new certification has been provided.  \n1.2.10\tPlanned Project Work (typically > \u00a35k) is managed centrally by the Property team and is generally driven by requirements from Operations; project work following acquisitions; mergers and/or relocation of practices and fabric PPMs.  \n1.2.11\tThere is no central helpdesk, no CAFM system and minimal formal knowledge management processes in place.   A business wide ticketing system is used in some instances, however this is not fit for purpose, is not used consistently across the estate and does not record project work or store key estate information.  A lot of knowledge is held in colleague\u2019s emails, locally stored files and in colleague\u2019s heads.\n1.2.12\tThe overarching strategic objectives for PortmanDentex\u2019s future FM solution are:  \n\u2022\tTo establish a new operating model that provides greater efficiency, transparency and visibility for the Property function \u2013 bringing ownership to all matters relating to the physical estate to the Property team.  This will deliver efficiency, create simplicity and consistency.  \n\u2022\tTo select an expert Service Provider who PortmanDentex can partner with to deliver the requirements of PortmanDentex.  \n\u2022\tTo improve service quality and internal customer focus.  \n\u2022\tTo introduce greater innovation and use of technology.  \n\u2022\tTo improve knowledge management across the estate and to have a \u2018single point of truth\u2019 for all matters regarding the entire estate.  \n\u2022\tTo implement greater spend control and visibility to enable significantly improved budgeting and future life cycle planning.  \n\u2022\tTo deliver significant cost savings to enable us to re-invest in our estate and future growth.  \n\u2022\tTo consolidate and drive value from the large, fragmented supply chain.

  Cost Saving and Cost Control \u2013 the new solution will deliver significant commercial benefit to PortmanDentex and will realise real cost savings that will hit the bottom line.
